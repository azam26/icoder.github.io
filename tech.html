                <p class="lead"> Technology ("science of craft", from Greek τέχνη, techne, "art, skill, cunning of
                    hand"; and -λογία, -logia[2]) is the sum of any techniques, skills, methods, and processes used in
                    the production of goods or services or in the accomplishment of objectives, such as scientific
                    investigation. Technology can be the knowledge of techniques, processes, and the like, or it can be
                    embedded in machines to allow for operation without detailed knowledge of their workings. Systems
                    (e.g. machines) applying technology by taking an input, changing it according to the system's use,
                    and then producing an outcome are referred to as technology systems or technological systems.</p>

                <h2 class="featurette-heading d-flex justify-content-center align-items-center">Technicism</h2>
                <p class="lead"> Generally, technicism is the belief in the utility of technology for improving human
                    societies.[57] Taken to an extreme, technicism "reflects a fundamental attitude which seeks to
                    control reality, to resolve all problems with the use of scientific–technological methods and
                    tools."[58] In other words, human beings will someday be able to master all problems and possibly
                    even control the future using technology. Some, such as Stephen V. Monsma,[59] connect these ideas
                    to the abdication of religion as a higher moral authority.Optimistic assumptions are made by
                    proponents of ideologies such as transhumanism and singularitarianism, which view technological
                    development as generally having beneficial effects for the society and the human condition. In these
                    ideologies, technological development is morally good.</p>

                <h2 class="featurette-heading">Complex technological systems </h2>
                <p class="lead"> Thomas P. Hughes stated that because technology has been considered as a key way to
                    solve problems, we need to be aware of its complex and varied characters to use it more
                    efficiently.[72] What is the difference between a wheel or a compass and cooking machines such as an
                    oven or a gas stove? Can we consider all of them, only a part of them, or none of them as
                    technologies?

                    Technology is often considered too narrowly; according to Hughes, "Technology is a creative process
                    involving human ingenuity".[73] This definition's emphasis on creativity avoids unbounded
                    definitions that may mistakenly include cooking "technologies," but it also highlights the prominent
                    role of humans and therefore their responsibilities for the use of complex technological systems.

                <h2 class="featurette-heading d-flex justify-content-center align-items-center">Future technology</h2>
                <p class="lead"> In 2005, futurist Ray Kurzweil predicted that the future of technology would mainly
                    consist of an overlapping "GNR Revolution" of genetics, nanotechnology and robotics, with robotics
                    being the most important of the three.[86] This future revolution has been explored in films,
                    novels, and video games, which have predicted the creation of many inventions, as well as foreseeing
                    future events. Such inventions and events include a government-controlled simulation that resulted
                    from massive robotics advancements (The Matrix), a society that has rid itself of procreation due to
                    improvements in genetic engineering (Brave New World), and a police state enforced by the government
                    using datamining, nanobots, and drones (Watch Dogs). Humans have already made some of the first
                    steps toward achieving the GNR revolution.

                    Recent discoveries and ingenuity has allowed us to create robotics in the form of Artificial
                    Intelligence, as well as in the physical form of robots. </p>
