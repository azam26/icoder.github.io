                    Advanced analytics, data visualization and data preparation capabilities are seamlessly combined.
                    The result? You have more time to explore data, get answers and react to situations in near-real

                <p class="lead"> Python is an interpreted high-level general-purpose programming language. Its design
                    philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of significant indentation. Its language
                    constructs and object-oriented approach aim to help programmers write clear, logical code for small-
                    and large-scale projects.
                    Python is dynamically-typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms,
                    including structured (particularly, procedural), object-oriented and functional programming. It is
                    often described as a "batteries included" language due to its comprehensive standard
                    library.[30][31]

                    Guido van Rossum began working on Python in the late 1980s, as a successor to the ABC programming
                    language, and first released it in 1991 as Python 0.9.0.[32] Python 2.0 was released in 2000 and
                    introduced new features such as list comprehensions, cycle-detecting garbage collection, reference
                    counting, and Unicode support. Python 3.0, released in 2008, was a major revision that is not
                    completely backward-compatible with earlier versions. Python 2 was discontinued with version 2.7.18
                    in 2020.

                    Language (SQL)</h2>
                <p class="lead">SQL is a domain-specific language used in programming and designed for managing data
                    held in a relational database management system, or for stream processing in a relational data
                    stream management system.Structured Query Language (SQL) is a standardized programming language that
                    is used to manage relational databases and perform various operations on the data in them.

                    SQL is used to communicate with a database. According to ANSI (American National Standards
                    Institute), it is the standard language for relational database management systems. SQL statements
                    are used to perform tasks such as update data on a database, or retrieve data from a database.
