                        <p class="card-text">A web desiginer is a programmer or a coder who specializes in, or is
                            specifically engaged in, the development of World Wide Web applications using a
                            client–server model. The applications typically use HTML, CSS and JavaScript in the client,
                            PHP, ASP.NET (C#), Python, Node.js, Go or Java in the server, and http for communications
                            between client and server. A web developer may specialize in client-side applications
                            (front-end developer), server-side applications (back-end developer), or both (full-stack
                            developer). A web content management system may be used to develop and maintain web
                            applications.</p>

                        <p class="card-text">CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content,
                            including layout, colors, and fonts.[3] This separation can improve content accessibility;
                            provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics;
                            enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate
                            .css file, which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content; and enable the
                            .css file to be cached to improve the page load speed between the pages that share the file
                            and its formatting.</p>

                            <p class="card-text">The HyperText Markup Language, or HTML is the standard markup language
                                for
                                documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It can be assisted by technologies
                                such
                                as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.

                                Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render
                                the
                                documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page
                                semantically
                                and originally included cues for the appearance of the document.

                                HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and
                                other
                                objects such as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page. HTML provides
                                a
                                means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as
                                headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items. HTML elements are delineated
                                by
                                tags, written using angle brackets. </p>

                <h2 class="featurette-heading d-flex justify-content-center align-items-center">PHP</h2>
                <p class="lead"> PHP is a general-purpose scripting language geared towards web development.[7] It was
                    originally created by Danish-Canadian programmer Rasmus Lerdorf in 1994.[8] The PHP reference
                    implementation is now produced by The PHP Group.[9] PHP originally stood for Personal Home Page,[8]
                    but it now stands for the recursive initialism PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor.[10]

                    PHP code is usually processed on a web server by a PHP interpreter implemented as a module, a daemon
                    or as a Common Gateway Interface (CGI) executable. On a web server, the result of the interpreted
                    and executed PHP code – which may be any type of data, such as generated HTML or binary image data –
                    would form the whole or part of an HTTP response. Various web template systems, web content
                    management systems, and web frameworks exist which can be employed to orchestrate or facilitate the
                    generation of that response.</p>

                <p class="lead"> Among Web professionals, "Web development" usually refers to the main non-design
                    aspects of building Web sites: writing markup and coding.[2] Web development may use content
                    management systems (CMS) to make content changes easier and available with basic technical skills.

                    For larger organizations and businesses, Web development teams can consist of hundreds of people
                    (Web developers) and follow standard methods like Agile methodologies while developing Web sites.
                    Smaller organizations may only require a single permanent or contracting developer, or secondary
                    assignment to related job positions such as a graphic designer or information systems technician.
                    Web development may be a collaborative effort between departments rather than the domain of a
                    designated department. There are three kinds of Web developer specialization: front-end developer,
                    back-end developer, and full-stack developer.

                <p class="lead"> A backend developer is one who makes use of the technology required to develop the
                    products for the backend of any website. A backend developer is responsible for building the
                    structure of a software application. Backend developers typically work in groups or with a team.
                    Their back end code adds utility to everything the front-end developer creates. These developers are
                    responsible for creating, maintaining, testing, and debugging the entire back end. This includes the
                    core application logic, databases, data and application integration, API and other back end
                    processes.
